# Flight-Prediction-Project
Flight Prediction Project for 642-R. Professor Vanessa Aguiar. Project was meant to be completed as a duo but partner did not respond in final week of project due data. Was completed solo. 

Models for SVM, Random Forest, and LDA were not running in time. Moved to future work section.

Code for those three models is a part of main RMD file. They were excluded from run as they took too long under time contraints.
